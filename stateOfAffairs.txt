Problems:
    1. database resets if someone accesses the admin page
        - can be fixed to check whether there is already an admin active, if not reset all the values of the database, otherwise dont
    2. you can switch from the admin page to the camera connect page while making it seem like there is an admin active
        - is the admin actually active? Does it always become negative no matter no you disconnect the serial port
    3. You could only set your name and id if the admin is active, and you reroute from the main page to the camera domain
    
TODO:
    3. Implement camera names and ids settings to be overwritten by the admin
    6. Implement name in line if the sameHeight is true

Extensions:
    1. Create sessions, which can be created by the admin, and then cameras can join based on this session's id.
